# UQ-in-Real-Time-Systems
This project analyzes an attempt at a new way to quantify uncertainty in real-time systems. Specifically, in the field of autonomous driving.

## Datasets

The code requires datasets that must be downloaded separately due to their size. Follow these steps:

1. Download the datasets from Kaggle:
   - Autonomous Arena(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/firstofhisname/indoor-car-track)
   - Traffic Signs Detection(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/cardetection)

2. Create a folder named `datasets/` in the project directory.

3. Place the downloaded files in the `datasets/` folder.
